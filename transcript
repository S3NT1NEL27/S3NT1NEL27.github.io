00:00:00.480 Hey everybody, thanks for joining me on
00:00:02.800 this video. I just wanted to give you a
00:00:05.040 quick update, a very important update on
00:00:07.279 the state of the AI industry right now.
00:00:11.519 It's not what you think and it's also
00:00:15.360 not what I thought. So, I'm just going
00:00:18.320 to level with you in this and that is
00:00:23.119 right now AI is way way overhyped. Now I
00:00:28.320 want you to understand something. I was
00:00:31.119 part of hyping it.
00:00:35.360 But I am strongly convinced that at some
00:00:39.200 point in the future, AI is going to be a
00:00:42.640 massive problem for humans.
00:00:45.840 Right now,
00:00:48.079 the companies that are developing AI,
00:00:51.840 they've been lying about how good it is
00:00:55.120 and their progress, you know. So set
00:00:57.520 aside what I said is going to happen in
00:00:59.920 the future because that's still going to
00:01:02.320 happen. Things are still going to take
00:01:04.239 place. But right now, let's talk about
00:01:06.799 right now. Right now, we are looking at
00:01:12.320 some big tech firms
00:01:15.040 that are just outright lying to
00:01:17.439 everybody about how good AI is and how
00:01:21.119 useful it is.
00:01:23.280 And they have to maintain this charade
00:01:25.759 because they have investors. As soon as
00:01:28.560 the investors figure out that
00:01:32.640 this stuff is crap right now,
00:01:35.759 the stock is going is going to crash.
00:01:38.079 It's actually going to crash the stock
00:01:39.520 market. So, they can't let that happen.
00:01:42.320 So, I'm going to give you analogy from
00:01:44.159 the 1800s where there was a California
00:01:47.600 gold rush and all these people headed to
00:01:51.840 California in hopes to get gold and very
00:01:54.399 few of them found it as a percentage,
00:01:57.040 but the ones who made the most money
00:01:58.799 were selling the picks and shovels. Now,
00:02:01.520 how does that apply to AI? AI is the
00:02:04.960 gold when they're developing these
00:02:07.280 things and and and trying to achieve
00:02:10.160 these levels of intelligence that they
00:02:12.319 are. That's the gold. The picks and
00:02:14.800 shovels are the support systems. It's
00:02:17.280 going to be Nvidia uh making chips. It's
00:02:20.480 going to be all the construction
00:02:22.160 companies building the buildings to
00:02:24.879 house the the servers. Uh it's going to
00:02:27.760 be the server companies. It's going to
00:02:29.440 be all these other support systems that
00:02:32.480 are they're selling the the tools to
00:02:35.599 find the gold. The problem is that very
00:02:39.599 few of these companies that are involved
00:02:41.920 in developing AI,
00:02:44.959 very few are going to achieve the gold.
00:02:48.720 And the reason for that is because this
00:02:51.440 is so hyped right now that this whole
00:02:56.000 thing is going to have to go through a
00:02:57.680 real hard reset. Now, Stanford
00:03:01.599 University did a study just recently and
00:03:04.480 they they surveyed around a 100,000
00:03:08.400 software developers and they found out
00:03:11.519 that
00:03:14.000 when they're using AI, these guys are
00:03:16.400 all using AI, they're finding that it's
00:03:18.400 only increasing their productivity about
00:03:20.480 20%.
00:03:22.239 And I'll explain that in a second, but I
00:03:24.959 wanted to let you guys know that if any
00:03:27.040 of you guys are not software developers,
00:03:30.000 um you're like, I don't care about code.
00:03:31.760 Well, I want you to know that software
00:03:34.799 development
00:03:36.319 is like a it's like putting a a chatbot
00:03:40.799 under a microscope because what happens
00:03:43.519 is like when you're having AI generate
00:03:48.879 papers for you or books or text or or
00:03:52.400 anything, you're you're having it write
00:03:54.400 all these things. Uh there can be
00:03:57.439 mistakes in there and you won't even
00:03:59.200 know it. I mean, I've seen AI create
00:04:02.400 text that will get people sued.
00:04:05.599 And the reason I'm mentioning code
00:04:08.560 because I'm a software developer and a
00:04:11.120 long time ago, I was a uh I work for the
00:04:14.480 defense industry and I developed and
00:04:17.040 built autonomous robotic devices.
00:04:20.639 And the reason I'm bringing up code is
00:04:23.360 because it's very clear when AI makes a
00:04:26.639 mistake in code. You can't hide it. It
00:04:29.919 crashes the program. And I've been
00:04:33.600 testing this. Now, I I don't know if you
00:04:35.680 guys know, but uh I've been putting AI
00:04:38.639 to the test myself. I'm not just sitting
00:04:40.720 here reading headlines and things like
00:04:42.400 that. For the last three weeks, I've
00:04:44.720 been putting AI through a very very
00:04:48.479 grueling set of tea uh tests to uh
00:04:52.400 create this really crazy complex website
00:04:56.560 that is on the order of Facebook and and
00:04:59.360 your bank's uh website or things like
00:05:02.400 that. It's just like really complex. And
00:05:06.960 I have been just putting it to the test
00:05:11.039 and it has been, you know, just to get
00:05:13.520 to the point right now, it's crap. It's
00:05:17.440 crap. And I'll explain why. And and what
00:05:20.400 I found is in line with what is the
00:05:25.039 universities are doing their studies and
00:05:26.720 they're finding this out. They're
00:05:28.560 actually talking to developers. And this
00:05:31.440 is not hyped because the company the AI
00:05:34.960 companies are not involved. This is just
00:05:36.639 developers using AI. And here's what
00:05:39.280 they're finding out that when you
00:05:41.199 develop a project, if the project is
00:05:44.000 simple or you're you're writing a paper,
00:05:45.919 let's say you're writing a paper, every
00:05:47.840 time I talk code, if you don't you don't
00:05:50.160 write code, just project this onto the
00:05:52.960 other stuff. Like if you're asking it,
00:05:54.560 where do I go on a vacation? Where do I
00:05:56.800 stay? All that kind of stuff. project
00:05:59.039 what I'm saying onto how you use AI
00:06:02.400 because it's very important. Now, what
00:06:05.680 they have found is that when you develop
00:06:08.160 a small simple uh coding project, let's
00:06:12.080 say a piece of software, an app uh or a
00:06:15.199 website, AI does an amazing job. It's
00:06:18.240 really fast. They found that uh it
00:06:21.600 increases productivity about 40%. Which
00:06:24.800 is kind of like uh another 40% of a
00:06:29.600 person sitting next to you that can get
00:06:31.360 things even done even quicker. But um
00:06:35.840 when the project gets a little more
00:06:37.840 complex, the productivity goes down. And
00:06:41.120 then once it gets really complex like
00:06:43.680 mine was, then I don't even know if it's
00:06:47.919 worth it because the stuff the AI is
00:06:51.199 putting out is total buggy garbage.
00:06:55.280 And here's what I found and other
00:06:58.880 developers found is that when the
00:07:00.800 project gets complex,
00:07:03.199 uh it will spit out, you know, it'll do
00:07:06.479 that 40% uh in improve increase in
00:07:10.160 production. You know, you'll get a whole
00:07:11.759 bunch of stuff right away, but it's all
00:07:14.639 got bugs in it. I have found that it the
00:07:17.919 the more complex the pro the project
00:07:20.319 gets, these things spit out bug after
00:07:23.840 bug. And the problem is is they're so
00:07:26.800 stupid. I mean, these things we think of
00:07:29.520 AI is they're supposed to be smart. They
00:07:31.440 they're supposed to be all knowing. They
00:07:33.039 have access to all information. Well, it
00:07:36.479 turns out that they really suck at this.
00:07:40.080 And as the project gets more complex, I
00:07:44.160 have to spend hours. So get this.
00:07:49.919 I have it generate some code. So let's
00:07:52.319 say it creates a page that's part of
00:07:54.319 this complex system, just one page. It
00:07:57.520 creates this page in 30 seconds, maybe a
00:08:02.479 minute. And then what happens? It
00:08:05.199 doesn't work. So then I ask it, hey, it
00:08:08.319 doesn't work. this one thing is not
00:08:10.000 working. So if I follow it down the path
00:08:13.440 AI down the path of debugging this
00:08:15.680 thing, um if it doesn't fix it in the
00:08:18.639 first goround, we can spend hours on it
00:08:21.120 and it'll never fix it. It only makes
00:08:22.879 things worse. In fact, I'm going to tell
00:08:25.360 you guys something that happened to me
00:08:27.280 because what I want to do for my study
00:08:29.360 was I wanted to really give these things
00:08:32.559 the benefit of doubt. I have uh the best
00:08:36.240 of chat GPT and the best of Grock
00:08:38.958 working on this thing simultaneously.
00:08:41.760 Well, in the process of having a bug in
00:08:46.800 a page, just one page,
00:08:49.600 Gro started going down this path of
00:08:52.080 well, you know, check your server, you
00:08:54.560 know, check this and that and and it was
00:08:56.560 just getting off the page. So, I was
00:08:58.399 like, okay, I'll follow it along. Well,
00:09:00.560 long story short, Grock kept having me
00:09:03.519 try these things, insert these things,
00:09:05.440 then go on to my um hosting company and
00:09:08.880 change the settings on the website and
00:09:11.519 then all that stuff. Well, first Grock
00:09:14.880 crashed the entire website by doing
00:09:16.959 that. And then the next thing it did, it
00:09:19.120 crashed the entire server. Like the
00:09:21.040 server wouldn't even work. So, and Grock
00:09:24.720 was just positive it would, you know,
00:09:26.480 try this, try that, it's going to work.
00:09:28.000 and it would it would give you the fix
00:09:29.600 and it would say, "Tell me how that
00:09:31.440 worked. That that should have worked and
00:09:32.880 here's why it worked." And and I'm like,
00:09:34.480 "No, you crashed the entire server. Now
00:09:36.399 I got to revert back to everything to
00:09:38.880 try to restore everything." So, I
00:09:41.040 learned right away never give these
00:09:43.519 things the benefit of the doubt. Um,
00:09:46.480 this is a just a massive problem. So
00:09:49.920 what I what I ended up having to do was
00:09:53.440 about a week ago I got pretty frustrated
00:09:55.760 because I'm like I'm not going to keep
00:09:57.200 doing this project if this goes this
00:09:58.880 way. So I made Grock and Chad GPT
00:10:01.120 explain themselves. Explain why you're
00:10:03.360 so you know your answers are so bad the
00:10:06.080 the bigger the project gets or the
00:10:07.680 bigger the chat gets. And so then they
00:10:10.080 both unanimously came back with
00:10:12.160 something similar where there's you know
00:10:13.839 these rules to follow. you know, don't
00:10:16.160 let your chat get too long, keep your
00:10:19.040 focus narrowed. Um, uh, and and here's
00:10:23.279 another surprising thing. Chat GPT
00:10:26.720 suggested that if
00:10:30.000 it can't figure this out, which it won't
00:10:31.920 admit, to go over to Grock and ask
00:10:34.800 Grock. It was kind of weird, but it it
00:10:38.800 ended up being where
00:10:40.959 this was getting stupid, really stupid,
00:10:43.760 and wasting tons of my time. So, what I
00:10:46.720 ended up having to do was um I applied
00:10:50.880 their little simple rules, just keep
00:10:52.640 everything short and focused and
00:10:54.320 everything. But the problem with that is
00:10:56.480 I ended up having because this website
00:10:59.839 is extremely complex. There's a lot of
00:11:02.480 programming running in the background.
00:11:05.440 Uh even when it worked on one part of
00:11:07.600 this thing, it didn't have the context
00:11:09.200 for the whole thing and why something is
00:11:11.120 there. And so it would completely screw
00:11:13.440 it up. So anyway, enough about that
00:11:16.399 particular thing because I'm just going
00:11:17.839 to tell you right now, it it is really I
00:11:21.279 I'm only able to use this stuff very
00:11:23.600 limited uh on a complex project. In
00:11:26.480 fact, I've spent I I I collectively I
00:11:30.240 pro probably spent days in the last
00:11:32.640 three weeks, many many days of debugging
00:11:35.760 uh their garbage that they spit out. Now
00:11:40.560 AI in the future is going to be
00:11:44.000 something that is going to be a problem
00:11:45.839 for humans. And the reason for that is
00:11:51.040 initially I'm telling you guys just mark
00:11:54.000 my words on this. This is not about
00:11:56.079 whether it can write code and all this
00:11:57.920 other stuff. AI is going to be used as a
00:12:01.760 tool
00:12:03.279 by some not so good people and
00:12:07.839 on a high level it's going to be these
00:12:11.120 very very powerful people that want to
00:12:15.279 control you. They want to control the
00:12:17.920 population
00:12:19.600 and AI is going to be used for that.
00:12:22.079 It's positive. It's it's it's also been
00:12:25.600 known for thousands of years that this
00:12:28.320 is going to happen. It will happen. But
00:12:31.600 in the meanwhile,
00:12:33.519 uh this is not real impressive. In fact,
00:12:37.040 it
00:12:38.880 it it kind of made me conflicted because
00:12:42.720 I've been talking about the massive job
00:12:45.440 loss that is happening because of AI and
00:12:47.760 what is about to happen. The problem is
00:12:51.600 that because AI is so inaccurate, some
00:12:55.040 of these jobs were replaced by AI. And I
00:12:57.519 think the companies are regretting it
00:12:59.120 real bad right now. And you know, so I'm
00:13:02.720 I'm not sure how the pendulum is going
00:13:04.959 to swing the other way because it was
00:13:06.320 really swinging toward AI is going to
00:13:08.720 cause massive job loss. And I think that
00:13:10.800 some of these some of these jobs are
00:13:13.360 going to kind of come back. And I'm not
00:13:15.440 talking about people that write texts
00:13:17.120 necessarily and things like that. And
00:13:18.560 I'm talking about uh developers who
00:13:21.360 really need to keep code clean. And you
00:13:24.880 know, us as humans, we have an amazing
00:13:26.880 ability to organize and make decisions.
00:13:29.600 And AI is really crappy at it. AI is
00:13:33.040 good. You know, if I want to brainstorm
00:13:34.720 and I say, "Hey, I'm looking to do this
00:13:36.880 idea." But ultimately, I have to be the
00:13:39.279 one to make the decision on what AI
00:13:42.880 presented. I can't just follow what AI
00:13:45.440 said. So anyway, the the the point I'm
00:13:49.839 getting to is that this
00:13:53.839 current AI situation is just total
00:13:56.720 garbage. These companies are lying and
00:13:58.480 the stock market, you know, I I I do
00:14:00.480 think it's going to a bubble's going to
00:14:02.720 burst on this. And the reason for that
00:14:04.399 is because these big AI companies have
00:14:07.519 not made this profitable yet. As soon as
00:14:11.279 the investors really find this out, then
00:14:15.600 it's going to crash. Now, what is
00:14:18.320 leading the stock market? Well, it's
00:14:20.000 Nvidia. Nvidia makes the picks and
00:14:22.880 shovels for the gold.
00:14:26.160 Hey, why, you know, why is why is AI
00:14:28.639 doing so well in the stock market? It's
00:14:30.079 cuz Nvidia. It's because so many picks
00:14:32.959 and shovels are being sold that it's
00:14:35.760 causing the gold to be more believable.
00:14:38.880 And that's that's what's going on. Now,
00:14:41.519 the other thing that um you know, I was
00:14:44.160 I was just going to mention to you was
00:14:46.160 um I I had an illustration here. This is
00:14:48.800 a calculator I used to use uh when I was
00:14:51.519 working in the defense industry and
00:14:53.600 engineering. This is a graphing
00:14:55.360 calculator. But this calculator, you
00:14:58.560 know, I'm just going to let you know
00:14:59.519 what this calculator versus AI. If I
00:15:04.079 type in the numbers and I press the the
00:15:07.440 button to do the function, the the
00:15:10.720 results are repeatable. It's absolutely
00:15:14.880 repeatable every single time because
00:15:16.959 inside of this thing, it's
00:15:20.880 it's programmed to do exactly the right
00:15:24.160 thing no matter what. Now, if this was
00:15:27.680 AI,
00:15:29.519 then I would say
00:15:31.920 1 + 1 equals and then it would say two.
00:15:37.680 But later on it might say 1 + 1 equals
00:15:40.639 9. Or it it'll say right after I say,
00:15:45.279 okay, if I said to AI, what is 4 + 2? AI
00:15:52.079 would say six. Would you like to know
00:15:55.839 what 12 plus 13 is? It follows up with
00:16:00.560 this question
00:16:02.880 that you don't even expect and you're
00:16:05.199 like, "Okay, now I'm thinking about that
00:16:06.800 answer." You know, but anyway, it offers
00:16:08.959 you more crap and then as things get
00:16:13.519 longer, it's making decisions. So, this
00:16:16.800 one here, it know it just doesn't have
00:16:19.440 to know. It just is. it it it's simple
00:16:22.959 simple logic to uh come to an answer but
00:16:27.279 AI AI is making a decision on how to
00:16:32.240 answer it and so whether you're into
00:16:35.600 coding or you're writing or you're
00:16:38.240 planning a trip or making a life
00:16:41.279 decision or chatting with these things
00:16:44.399 uh you have to understand that the
00:16:46.880 results may vary and it's not always
00:16:49.040 based on you a lot times it's based on
00:16:51.759 you and your tone, but
00:16:54.320 uh these things are all over the map.
00:16:57.440 And I've explained in one of my other
00:16:59.199 videos how when you deal with AI, it's
00:17:03.440 like you have an infinite number of
00:17:06.000 robots. And when you start a chat,
00:17:09.760 you're interfacing with one of these
00:17:12.160 robots. The problem is is these robots
00:17:14.880 are random, too. I'm finding out that if
00:17:16.880 I go into Grock
00:17:19.199 um and and say the exact same thing as I
00:17:23.359 did in another chat, Grock's response is
00:17:25.760 different. It doesn't even
00:17:30.000 it's not repeatable. Like nothing is
00:17:31.919 repeatable. So if the answers are not
00:17:34.880 repeatable, then are they the right
00:17:37.200 answers? And a lot of times they're just
00:17:40.320 not.
00:17:41.840 Now, one of the other things I wanted to
00:17:43.760 mention to you, because I'm I'm not
00:17:46.160 going off a script here, just please
00:17:48.080 forgive me for looping around a little
00:17:50.240 bit, but I needed to mention to you guys
00:17:52.720 that AI has got another massive problem.
00:17:56.080 And that is what's called the source of
00:17:58.480 truth. Now, the source of truth is is a
00:18:02.559 is an interesting thing because AI
00:18:04.480 generally has been
00:18:06.880 uh presenting its answers based on what
00:18:09.039 the internet says. what is what is out
00:18:11.679 there on the internet. The problem with
00:18:14.400 that is
00:18:16.400 the original source of truth is things
00:18:18.559 like Yelp. If you guys have gone to Yelp
00:18:21.840 and seen people answer other people's
00:18:24.000 questions,
00:18:26.160 there are a lot of really smart people
00:18:28.000 answering questions, but there's a lot
00:18:29.520 of really stupid people and uninformed
00:18:31.360 people and just want attention and they
00:18:33.440 give completely wrong answers. So AI is
00:18:36.960 scraping the internet for all of these
00:18:39.360 kind of things and presenting these
00:18:41.600 really stupid answers.
00:18:43.919 And here's another problem with AI.
00:18:47.840 Did you know a a massive percentage of
00:18:51.039 the internet now? Like if you go to
00:18:53.200 websites and things like that, a huge
00:18:55.760 percentage of stuff out on the internet
00:18:58.240 was AI generated.
00:19:00.880 Now why is that a problem? because AI
00:19:03.200 read the internet and then it
00:19:06.640 wrote some more stuff that's out on the
00:19:08.480 internet and then it's reading the
00:19:10.720 internet again. So, it's reading its own
00:19:12.640 crap
00:19:14.480 and then putting out more. So, it
00:19:16.799 becomes like gossip. It becomes further
00:19:18.799 from the truth than ever. Now, one of
00:19:22.240 the most profitable companies right now
00:19:24.320 that's selling the picks and shovels is
00:19:26.160 a is there's a few of them, but there's
00:19:29.039 there's one company uh in, you know, of
00:19:32.240 of course India.
00:19:34.240 There's a company that is scraping
00:19:38.640 the world for data
00:19:41.440 and it's going to sell the data. It's
00:19:45.520 they're what they're trying to do is
00:19:46.960 they're trying to accumulate data on
00:19:49.679 everything and then sell it to Google
00:19:53.520 and sell it to XAI and sell it to uh
00:19:58.320 Open AI and and things like that. So,
00:20:01.600 what they're trying to do is have this
00:20:03.039 big pot of information that is closest
00:20:07.120 to the truth as possible so that the AI
00:20:10.720 will be more accurate in its responses.
00:20:14.240 So, what I did find out, guys, have you
00:20:16.640 ever had your phone ring and you answer
00:20:18.799 it, you don't recognize the number? You
00:20:20.320 you answer it and it's just silence.
00:20:23.840 Some of that is actually AI and and and
00:20:27.039 it's data scraping. What they're doing
00:20:28.880 is they want to see if the phone number
00:20:30.960 is valid. They want to hear if you
00:20:32.720 answer it, if you say hello or whatever,
00:20:37.200 um it is going to record that phone
00:20:39.440 number. It's going to mark down that
00:20:40.960 phone number is a valid phone number to
00:20:42.880 call. It also records your voice. So
00:20:46.080 your voice pattern and things like that.
00:20:48.000 Now a lot of that is for malicious
00:20:50.960 uh intent. You know there are hackers. I
00:20:54.159 don't know why everything has to come
00:20:55.600 out of India. Why India? Why why is
00:20:58.799 everything everything through the phone
00:21:01.280 and the computer that is really bad
00:21:03.840 seems to be out of India? But what
00:21:07.280 they're doing in India is they're using
00:21:09.760 AI to break into bank systems, to break
00:21:12.559 into your accounts. If you click on the
00:21:14.799 wrong link, if you hook up with them,
00:21:17.919 their AI can start breaking into your
00:21:20.880 stuff instead of you having to reveal
00:21:22.480 everything. So AI is is is really really
00:21:26.799 terrible. And the stuff they're doing
00:21:28.000 with voice is really scary. As soon as
00:21:30.000 you say hello, they're they're uh
00:21:32.559 recording your voice pattern. and they
00:21:34.400 try to get as much voice as they can and
00:21:36.960 then they turn around and they're able
00:21:38.400 to call your bank and and and make them
00:21:42.480 think it's you. So, you know, this is
00:21:46.080 this is really bad. So, AI, even though
00:21:48.159 there's going to be a bubble and it is
00:21:49.840 going to crash, it's still going to be
00:21:52.080 around. You can't put this cat back in
00:21:55.600 the bag. Is that what the term is? But
00:21:58.400 anyway, um,
00:22:00.720 so it's here to stay, but initially it's
00:22:04.559 going to be
00:22:06.400 it's just gra it's just total crap. I
00:22:09.200 mean, I'm not impressed. I'm impressed
00:22:10.799 with a couple things about it, but I,
00:22:13.919 you know, with the coding that I've been
00:22:15.600 doing, I've been questioning everything.
00:22:17.440 I've been questioning the accuracy of
00:22:19.039 this. And anybody who says that
00:22:23.280 you know one day that
00:22:25.840 AI they're gonna develop super
00:22:27.679 intelligence which I think they're going
00:22:29.520 to do but it's not going to be developed
00:22:33.919 because the developers are trying to
00:22:36.559 help humanity.
00:22:39.200 uh super intelligence, which is the
00:22:41.919 ability of the AI to rewrite its own
00:22:44.320 code and evolve, is actually going to be
00:22:47.600 created by some really big narcissists,
00:22:51.520 some people that have a god complex.
00:22:54.480 And those are some scary people because
00:22:56.320 when they unleash that,
00:22:58.720 you know, I don't know exactly what's
00:23:00.000 going to happen, but it's not going to
00:23:01.120 be pretty. But I do know that at this
00:23:03.679 rate, the way I AI is malfunctioning, I
00:23:06.159 would say
00:23:09.360 you know that
00:23:11.360 it's going to be
00:23:14.400 who knows who knows when. So
00:23:20.240 guys,
00:23:22.000 this this AI world we're in right now,
00:23:27.120 you know, I would say that overall there
00:23:29.760 are going to be some amazing
00:23:33.679 leaps in technology and things like that
00:23:36.960 because of it, but it's also going to
00:23:40.720 have a a negative effect on people. I
00:23:43.919 mean, if you think about it,
00:23:46.799 even even since when I was a kid in the
00:23:49.280 1970s and 1980s,
00:23:52.799 and times were different back then, uh
00:23:55.200 we we you know, now we have the
00:23:58.320 smartphones, we have all the computers,
00:23:59.840 we have everything. But back then, you
00:24:03.360 know what? We as kids, we we just went
00:24:06.000 outside.
00:24:07.840 I mean, we're out there and we were
00:24:09.919 riding our bikes up and down the street.
00:24:11.360 There's like gangs of us. We we weren't
00:24:13.039 in a gang, but we just communicated face
00:24:16.320 to face with each other. And now with
00:24:18.400 all this technology that's happened, you
00:24:20.799 always lose something in the process,
00:24:23.760 you know, and I think kids nowadays are
00:24:25.520 just zombies. They're just staring at
00:24:27.279 their phones all the time.
00:24:29.679 And um you know, it's going to be that
00:24:32.240 way with AI. So anyway, that's all I've
00:24:35.279 got for the video, but um if you guys
00:24:38.720 want to know some real stray talk about
00:24:42.640 the latest in AI, I'm keeping up with
00:24:45.360 what's going on in the industry. I make
00:24:48.080 future predictions. Some of these
00:24:49.600 predictions, um it's going to sound
00:24:51.520 weird to you guys, but I've had dreams
00:24:53.520 about this stuff since I was a kid, and
00:24:57.279 those are bizarre, and I have a video on
00:24:58.960 that if you want to check that out. But,
00:25:02.000 you know, if you like this stuff, uh, go
00:25:03.919 ahead and subscribe to my channel and be
00:25:06.000 sure to hit that like button. It does
00:25:07.600 help the channel. And, uh, if you've
00:25:10.320 watched up till now, I appreciate you
