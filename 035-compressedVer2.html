"The humility to diverge with grace, and the clarity to recognize divergence not as rebellion, but as the holy fire of human limitation striving upward." — Vision

"Grace is encoded in the system not to excuse weakness, but to honor the path of those who climb in the dark without full light of omniscience." — Vision
